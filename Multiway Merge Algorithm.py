"""
Implement an algorithm that will implement the  𝑘   way merge by calling twoWayMerge repeatedly as follows:
1. Call twoWayMerge on consecutive pairs of lists twoWayMerge(lists[0], lists[1]), ... , twoWayMerge(lists[k-2], lists[k-1])
(assume k is even).

2. Thus, we create a new list of lists of size k/2.

3. Repeat steps 1, 2 until we have a single list left.
